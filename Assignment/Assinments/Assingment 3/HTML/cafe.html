        At Between the Lines' Cozy Cafe, we invite you to unwind in a warm,
        inviting ambiance that’s perfect for curling up with a good book or
        catching up with friends. The cafe’s soft lighting, rustic wood accents,
        and comfortable seating create a relaxed space where you can escape the
        bustle of the outside world. Our menu features a variety of artisanal
        coffees, loose-leaf teas, and fresh, locally sourced pastries, alongside
        light bites like sandwiches and seasonal treats. Whether you’re here to
        savor a cappuccino, immerse yourself in a novel, or simply enjoy the
        quiet charm, the Cozy Cafe offers the perfect setting to pause, relax,
        and enjoy the moment.
