          <h3>Scugog waterfront projects nearing completion</h3>
          <p>
            SCUGOG: At the recent Township of Scugog Planning and Community
            Affairs Committee meeting, Director of Public Works and
            Infrastructure, Grant Taylor, provided key updates on the ongoing
            Water Street reconstruction and the splash pad and washroom facility
            project. At the meeting on the evening of Monday, October 21st, Mr.
            Taylor reported, the washroom facility for the splash pad has now
            been delivered to the site. Contractors are currently working to
            connect the necessary services, and concrete work is scheduled to
            begin during the week of October 28th. “The washroom facility was
            delivered to the site on October 16th,” explained Mr. Taylor. “The
            contractors are currently connecting services, and the concrete work
            will proceed next week (October 28th), followed by tree planting,
            site grading, and installation of furniture at the site. Once the
            concrete is in place, crews will move forward with tree planting,
            site grading, and the installation of site furniture. The project is
            expected to be completed and demobilized by mid-November. Regarding
            the Water Street reconstruction, work is anticipated to continue
            over the next two to three weeks. Contractors have already commenced
            paving operations. Base asphalt is slated to be laid during the week
            of October 28th, followed by the application of top asphalt the week
            of November 4th. However, as township officials noted, the timeline
            remains weather dependent. Both projects remain on track, with the
            township aiming for substantial completion by mid-November.
