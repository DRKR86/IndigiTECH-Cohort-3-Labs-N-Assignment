      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        The Folk & Indie Festival is organized by a team of passionate music
        lovers, event planners, and community advocates, all deeply connected to
        the heart of Austin, Texas. With years of experience in event
        production, curating music, and fostering local talent, our team is
        united by a shared vision: to create a festival that embodies the spirit
        of Austin—a city known for its rich music culture, creative expression,
        and inclusivity. Our mission is simple: to provide a platform for
        independent musicians and artists, to create an environment where
        attendees can enjoy world-class performances, connect with local
        creators, and experience the magic of Austin’s live music scene in a
        welcoming, family-friendly atmosphere. From booking incredible indie and
        folk artists to designing an eco-conscious festival, we strive to put
        our values into every aspect of the event. We believe in supporting the
        local economy, which is why we prioritize working with Austin-based food
        vendors, artisans, and small businesses. By doing this, we not only
        provide a stage for independent artists but also celebrate the diverse
        talent in the Austin community. Our team has a strong belief in
        fostering inclusivity and sustainability. We are committed to making the
        festival accessible to people of all backgrounds, and we provide
        programs and activities for all ages, from toddlers to adults. We also
        take our environmental responsibility seriously—our team works hard to
        reduce waste, use sustainable materials, and create a festival that
        aligns with Austin’s forward-thinking, eco-friendly culture.
