        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <br />
        <p class="note">
          The Folk & Indie Festival is organized by a team of passionate music
          lovers, event planners, and community advocates, all deeply connected
          to the heart of Austin, Texas. With years of experience in event
          production, curating music, and fostering local talent, our team is
          united by a shared vision: to create a festival that embodies the
          spirit of Austin—a city known for its rich music culture, creative
          expression, and inclusivity. Our mission is simple: to provide a
          platform for independent musicians and artists, to create an
          environment where attendees can enjoy world-class performances,
          connect with local creators, and experience the magic of Austin’s live
          music scene in a welcoming, family-friendly atmosphere. From booking
          incredible indie and folk artists to designing an eco-conscious
          festival, we strive to put our values into every aspect of the event.
          We believe in supporting the local economy, which is why we prioritize
          working with Austin-based food vendors, artisans, and small
          businesses. By doing this, we not only provide a stage for independent
          artists but also celebrate the diverse talent in the Austin community.
          Our team has a strong belief in fostering inclusivity and
          sustainability. We are committed to making the festival accessible to
          people of all backgrounds, and we provide programs and activities for
          all ages, from toddlers to adults. We also take our environmental
          responsibility seriously—our team works hard to reduce waste, use
          sustainable materials, and create a festival that aligns with Austin’s
          forward-thinking, eco-friendly culture.

        <h3>Our History</h3>
        <br />
        <p class="note">
          The Folk & Indie Festival began in 2 as a small gathering of music
          enthusiasts and local artists, looking to bring a fresh, authentic
          vibe to Austin’s rich festival landscape. What started as a humble
          event has grown over the years into one of the city's most anticipated
          celebrations of independent music and culture. With a focus on
          intimate performances, community engagement, and sustainable
          practices, the festival has become a beloved tradition for locals and
          visitors alike. Our team is proud to have played a role in shaping the
          festival into what it is today, and we look forward to many more years
          of music, connection, and creativity.
