        A tip calculator is a simple tool that helps you calculate how much tip
        to leave based on the total bill amount and your preferred tip
        percentage. Here’s how it works: Input the Bill Amount: The first step
        is to enter the total amount of your bill (e.g., the cost of a meal or
        service). Choose the Tip Percentage: Decide what percentage of the bill
        you’d like to tip. Common percentages are 10%, 15%, 20%, or any amount
        you choose. Calculate the Tip Amount: The calculator multiplies the bill
        amount by the tip percentage (converted to a decimal). For example, a
        20% tip on a $50 bill is calculated as: 50 × 0.20 = 10 50×0.20=10 So,
        the tip is $10. Determine the Total Amount: The calculator adds the tip
        to the original bill to show you the total amount to pay. Using the
        previous example: 50 + 10 = 60 50+10=60 The total is $60. Split the Bill
        (Optional): Some calculators let you divide the total amount among
        multiple people to show how much each person owes. By automating the
        math, a tip calculator saves time and ensures accuracy, especially when
        splitting bills or calculating unconventional tip percentages.
