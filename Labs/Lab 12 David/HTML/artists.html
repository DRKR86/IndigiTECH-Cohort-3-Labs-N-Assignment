            culture and family. He says that his art allows him to find peace
            and self fulfillment as he reflects on his life and experiences in
            the pursuit of his creativity. Mike finds inspiration through his
            ancestors who made art for the generations that came after them. He
            says, “I am inspired by the thought that my people made paintings
            with me and my survival in mind.” In addition to his visual arts
            career, Mike is also a gifted writer and poet. His poetry and
            articles have appeared in various magazines. In 2020, Mike became an

          <h3>Francis Dick</h3>
          <p>
            Born in 1959 into the Musqamakw Dzawadaenutw Band (the four tribes
            of Kingcome Inlet), Francis Dick is a contemporary Native artist and
            a member of the Kwakwaka’wakw Nation. She is a descendant of the
            supernatural Wolf, Kawadelekala, who became the first of the
            Kingcome people. The image of this mythical being is prominent in
            much of Francis Dick’s native art, acknowledging her contemporary
            ties to her cultural heritage. Francis holds this very near to the
            centre of her spirit, as she relies on this hereditary knowledge for
            her strength. “Before anything else, my work is about honouring my
            life process, my journey, through my fires, from places of pain and
            darkness to places that I might stand in my truth; my work is not a
            career, it’s a way of life.”
          </p>

          <h3>Derek Heaton</h3>
          <p>
            Derek was born in 1970 as a member of the Mi’kmaq Nation in Quebec.
            At the very young age of five Derek took up painting, but it wasn’t
            until he moved to the West coast that he learned how to carve. This
            is also where he started his journey of self discovery and healing
            through his Native roots. Derek took inspiration from Northwest
            coast artists such as Willie Seaweed, Tim Paul, Bill Reid and Art
            Thompson. His creative abilities and imagination have earned him
            acceptance and recognition from many accomplished artists and art
            collectors. Derek was adopted by the Haida Nation.

          <h3>Joe Wilson</h3>
          <p>
            oe Wilson is a Coast Salish artist who was born in 1967, and raised
            at Koksilah near the small city of Duncan on Vancouver Island,
            British Columbia. His keen interest in native art began at the
            tender age of 12 whilst watching his stepfather, Johnny Sampson,
            design and carve beautiful native artworks. However, fierce
            competition with his younger brother, Rick, motivated Joe to take
            his artistry seriously: “That’s when I frustratingly started really
            applying myself. Even back then I had it in my heart to be one of
            the best out there in our field [Coast Salish Territory] and I did
            it.” At the young age of 17, Joe began producing and marketing his
            various Aboriginal paintings and carvings within the local region.
            Since then, he has apprenticed under master carvers such as the late
            Simon Charlie and Coast Salish artist Charles Elliott, and studied
            under Nuu-Chah-nulth master carver Tim Paul at the Royal British
            Columbia Museum. Joe has studied northwest coast native art
            extensively and has emerged as one of the most prolific Coast Salish
            artists today. A soft-spoken man, Joe’s northwest coast Native art
            speaks of confidence and strength and has a unique and original
            style. His colours are bold and unconventional, yet extremely
            appealing and rich.

          <h3>Lawrence Paul Yuxweluptun</h3>
          <p>
            Lawrence Paul Yuxweluptun is a Cowichan/Syilx First Nations
            contemporary artist from Canada. His paintings employ elements of
            Northwest Coast formline design and Surrealism to explore issues as
            environmentalism, land ownership, and Canada's treatment of First
            Nations peoples
