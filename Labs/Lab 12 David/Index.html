          <h2>Introduction to Indigenous Art</h2>
          <p>
            Indigenous art is a profound expression of culture, identity, and
            ancestral knowledge, passed down through generations and evolving
            with each new artist. Rooted in connection to the land, community,
            and spirituality, Indigenous art often reflects both traditional
            values and contemporary experiences. Every brushstroke, bead,
            carving, and design tells a story—of resilience, heritage, and
            belonging. Across various Indigenous nations, art takes many forms,
            from intricate beadwork and textile designs to powerful paintings,
            sculptures, and digital media. Each piece is unique, often featuring
            symbols and motifs representing nature, family, and the cosmos.
            Techniques and styles may vary greatly across regions, reflecting
            the diversity within Indigenous cultures, but a common thread
            remains: art as a way of preserving history, celebrating identity,
            and sharing wisdom. At Between the Lines, we invite you to explore
            this showcase as more than an exhibit. It’s a journey through the
            stories, perspectives, and talents of Indigenous artists whose works
            connect past, present, and future. Each piece is an invitation to
            experience the world through the eyes of its creator, offering a
            glimpse into the beauty and depth of Indigenous artistry.
