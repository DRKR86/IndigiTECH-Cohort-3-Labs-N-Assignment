        <h2>Introduction to Indigenous Art</h2>
        <p>
          Indigenous art is a profound expression of culture, identity, and
          ancestral knowledge, passed down through generations and evolving with
          each new artist. Rooted in connection to the land, community, and
          spirituality, Indigenous art often reflects both traditional values
          and contemporary experiences. Every brushstroke, bead, carving, and
          design tells a story—of resilience, heritage, and belonging. Across
          various Indigenous nations, art takes many forms, from intricate
          beadwork and textile designs to powerful paintings, sculptures, and
          digital media. Each piece is unique, often featuring symbols and
          motifs representing nature, family, and the cosmos. Techniques and
          styles may vary greatly across regions, reflecting the diversity
          within Indigenous cultures, but a common thread remains: art as a way
          of preserving history, celebrating identity, and sharing wisdom. At
          Between the Lines, we invite you to explore this showcase as more than
          an exhibit. It’s a journey through the stories, perspectives, and
          talents of Indigenous artists whose works connect past, present, and
          future. Each piece is an invitation to experience the world through
          the eyes of its creator, offering a glimpse into the beauty and depth
          of Indigenous artistry.
