        <h2>Cowshit in The Morning</h2>
        <p>
          “Cowshit in the Morning” is a raw, humorous song that captures the
          gritty reality of rural life with a blend of wit and honesty. With
          lyrics that paint a vivid picture of early-morning chores on a
          farm—complete with the earthy smell and the unglamorous tasks—it’s
          both funny and relatable for anyone familiar with country living. The
          tune has a laid-back, folksy vibe, often accompanied by acoustic
          guitar or banjo, and serves as an ode to the unpolished beauty of the
          countryside, where hard work and resilience define the rhythm of life.
